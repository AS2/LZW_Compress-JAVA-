#           - DIR_FILE - path to result file (can be created, if it doesn't exist)
#           - LOG_PATH - path to program log (can be created, if it doesn't exist)
#           - READER_CLASS - Name of reader module (class)
#           - EXECUTOR_CLASSES - Names of executors modules (classes)
#           - WRITER_CLASS - Name of writer module (class)
#           - EXECUTOR_CONFIGS - Paths of executors modules (classes) configs
#           - READER_CONFIG - Paths of reader module (class) config
#           - WRITER_CONFIG - Paths of writer module (class) config

# 2) EXECUTOR'S NAMES ORDER SETS IMPLICITY, SEPARATED BY COMMAS.
# 3) EXECUTOR'S CONFIGS PATHS SETS IN THE SAME WAY, LIKE ORDER TO EXECUTOR'S NAMES
